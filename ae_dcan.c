	/**
	 * Now the actual bit timing register value:
	 * 
	 * DCAN module in AM3359 is supplied with two clocks: interface clock and functional clock.
	 * Functional clock runs the actual module and encodes / decodes packet frames, etc.. It is
	 * equal to CLK_M_OSC - the high speed system clock, which can be 19.2 - 26 MHz. In the case
	 * of Phytec's AM335x modules it is: 25 MHz
	 *
	 * Interface clock puts the bits onto the physical interface (the actual can bus wires). It
	 * taken from pd_per_l3_gclk (a.k.a. CORE_CLKOUTM4 and ocp_clk) dividing it by two. Usually
	 * (and in case of Phytec's AM335x modules) CORE_CLKOUTM4 = 200 MHz, so our interface clock
	 * is 100 MHz.
	 *
	 * Out of these two we need interface clock to calculate tq (time quanta).
	 * writing bit time values to BTR.
	 * 
	 * As per page 4801 in user's manual:
	 * Usually, the calculation of the bit timing configuration starts with a desired bit rate or bit time. The resulting
	 * bit time (1 / Bit rate) must be an integer multiple of the CAN clock period. 
	 * 
	 * AE: For our 100 MHz interface clock, the clock period = 1 / (10^8) = 10ns = cp
	 * AE: Let's say we want 1 MBit/s, so our bit time will be 1 / (10^6) = 1us = 100 * cp
	 * 
	 * The bit time may consist of 8 to 25 time quanta. The length of the time quantum tq is defined by the baud rate 
	 * prescaler with tq = (Baud Rate Prescaler) / CAN_CLK. Several combinations may lead to the desired bit time, 
	 * allowing iterations of the following steps.
	 * 
	 * AE: Let's make our 1us bit time to be convenient 10 tq. So 1tq = 100ns
	 * 
	 * First part of the bit time to be defined is the Prop_Seg. Its length depends on the delay times measured in
	 * the system. A maximum bus length as well as a maximum node delay has to be defined for expandible CAN bus systems. 
	 * The resulting time for Prop_Seg is converted into time quanta (rounded up to the nearest integer multiple of tq).
	 * 
	 * AE: Let's assume for now that Prop_Seg = 230ns, so 3tq. Prop_Seg = 3tq.
	 * 
	 * The Sync_Seg is 1 tq long (fixed), leaving (bit time – Prop_Seg – 1) tq for the two Phase Buffer Segments. If the 
	 * number of remaining tq is even, the Phase Buffer Segments have the same length, Phase_Seg2 = Phase_Seg1, else 
	 * Phase_Seg2 = Phase_Seg1 + 1.
	 * 
	 * AE: So we have (10 - 3 - 1) = 6tq left for the two phase buffer segments => Phase_Seg2 = Phase_Seg1 = 3tq
	 * 
	 * The minimum nominal length of Phase_Seg2 has to be regarded as well. Phase_Seg2 may not be shorter than any CAN 
	 * controller’s Information Processing Time in the network, which is device dependent and can be in the range of [0…2] tq.
	 * 
	 * The length of the synchronization jump width is set to its maximum value, which is the minimum of four (4) and Phase_Seg1.
	 * 
	 * AE: So SJW = Phase_Seg1 = 3tq
	 * 
	 * The oscillator tolerance range necessary for the resulting configuration is calculated by the formulas given 
	 * in Section 23.3.16.2.3. 
	 * 
	 * If more than one configurations are possible to reach a certain Bit rate, it is recommended to choose the configuration 
	 * which allows the highest oscillator tolerance range. 
	 * 
	 * CAN nodes with different clocks require different configurations to come to the same bit rate. The calculation of the 
	 * propagation time in the CAN network, based on the nodes with the longest delay times, is done once for the whole network. 
	 * 
	 * The CAN system’s oscillator tolerance range is limited by the node with the lowest tolerance range. The calculation may 
	 * show that bus length or bit rate have to be decreased or that the oscillator frequencies’ stability has to be increased 
	 * in order to find a protocol compliant configuration of the CAN bit timing.
	 * 
	 * The resulting configuration is written into the bit timing register:
	 * Tseg2 = Phase_Seg2-1
	 * Tseg1 = Phase_Seg1+ Prop_Seg-1
	 * SJW = SynchronizationJumpWidth-1
	 * BRP = Prescaler-1
	 * 
	 * AE: So we get:
	 * Tseg2 = 3 - 1 = 2
	 * Tseg1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
	 * SJW = 3 - 1 = 2
	 * BRP = 1 - 1 = 0
	 * 
	 * AE: A note on BRP consideration as per user's manual:
	 * Baud rate prescaler. Value by which the CAN_CLK frequency is divided for generating the bit time quanta. The bit time is built 
	 * up from a multiple of this quanta. Valid programmed values are 0 to 63. The actual BRP value interpreted for the bit timing 
	 * will be the programmed BRP value + 1.
	 * 
	 * AE: Let's also calculate oscillator tolerance:
	 * 
	 * The tolerance range df for an oscillator’s frequency fosc around the nominal frequency fnom with:
	 * 
	 * (1 - df) * Fnom < Fosc < Fnom * (1 + df)
	 * 
	 * depends on the proportions of Phase_Seg1, Phase_Seg2, SJW, and the bit time. The maximum tolerance df is the defined by 
	 * two conditions (both shall be met):
	 * 
	 * 1) df <= min(TSeg1, TSeg2) / (2 * (13 * (bit_time - TSeg2)))
	 * 2) df <= SJW / (20 * bit_time)
	 * 
	 * AE: So: 
	 * AE: df <= 2 / 2 * 13 * 8 = 0.0096
	 * AE: df <= 2 / (20 * 10) = 0.01
	 * 
	 * AE: df = 0.96%
	 * 
	 * AE: Turning all that into a register value according to page 4819 (BTR register) in user's manual:
	 * 
	 * BTR = 0xA40;
